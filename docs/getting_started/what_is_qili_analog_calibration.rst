What is Qili-Analog-Calibration?
==================

Qili-analog-calibration is a generic and scalable calibration library used for 
fast calibration of analog quantum chips.

At the core of the Qili-Analog-Calibration package we have the :class:`~analog_calibration.automatic_calibration` object. 

This is your main script to create a calibration acyclic graph that will allow you to define the sequence, size, 
input and output parameters for your calibration experiments.
